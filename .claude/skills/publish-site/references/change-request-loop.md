# Change-request loop — "start your checking loop"

A dedicated, unattended session that drains player sheet-edit requests during
live play. The GM opens a spare terminal in the site directory, says **"start
your checking loop"**, reads out the code, and does not touch it again. Between
requests the session sits idle at **no model-token cost** — a background watcher
does the waiting, and you only wake when a request actually arrives.

## Prerequisites

- The inbox is set up (KV namespace + `wrangler.toml` id + deployed Function).
  See `references/cloudflare-pages.md` → "Change-request inbox".
- The system is GURPS 4e (v1). For other systems, stop and tell the GM this
  isn't supported yet.

## Start

1. Pick a memorable 4-character code (letters, e.g. `WOLF`, `BEAR`, `MOTH`).
2. Set it live:  `npx gm-apprentice-publish inbox open WOLF`
   (or `node <tool>/bin/gm-publish.js inbox open WOLF`).
3. Print it prominently for the GM to read to the table:
   `╔═══════════════╗  SESSION CODE: WOLF  ╚═══════════════╝`
4. Launch the **background watcher** (below), then leave the session idle. The
   watcher is a plain shell loop that polls the queue every ~30s and **sleeps
   while it is empty — spending no model tokens**. It exits (waking you) only
   when a request arrives.

   ```bash
   while :; do
     out=$(npx gm-apprentice-publish inbox pull 2>/dev/null)
     if [ -n "$out" ] && [ "$out" != "[]" ]; then printf '%s\n' "$out"; break; fi
     sleep 30
   done
   ```

   Run it as a **background command** (`run_in_background: true`). The harness
   re-invokes you when it exits — i.e. when the queue is non-empty — handing you
   the pending JSON. Idle time between requests therefore costs no model tokens;
   you only think when there is real work.

## When a batch arrives

The watcher hands you a JSON array of pending entries
`{id, character, text, timestamp, status}` (re-run `npx gm-apprentice-publish
inbox pull` if you want the freshest state). For each, in per-character
submission order (`timestamp` ascending), tracking **running unspent points**
(read the current value from the PC's `.md`):

1. **Classify** the `text`: a **sheet change** (imperative — spend/add/set/
   raise/remove/note) or a **question** (interrogative / advice-seeking). If
   genuinely unsure, treat it as a question — never edit the sheet on a guess.
2. **Change → apply, or refuse only when you must.** Default to trusting the
   player. Validate spends against GURPS costs using `ttrpg-expert`'s references
   (`systems/gurps-4e/character-generation.md`, `character-sheet.md`,
   `skills-*.md`, `traits-*.md`). Attributes: ST/HT 10/level, DX/IQ 20/level;
   skills/traits per those references. Then:
   - **Grants and narrative edits — always apply.** Adding XP to the character's
     own pool ("add 5 xp", "give me 3 points") or editing notes/current-status is
     trusted self-service: apply it, never flag it. An XP grant raises Unspent
     Points (and Total Points Earned). Collect into the applied batch; log a `✓`.
   - **Affordable & unambiguous spend — apply.** Edit the `.md`, decrement running
     unspent points, collect into the applied batch; log a `✓`.
   - **Player override — apply even if unaffordable.** If the request carries a
     trust signal — natural-language GM-approval or insistence such as "the GM
     said it's OK", "GM approved", "GM said to", "do it anyway", "override", "GM
     okayed it" — apply the spend even when it's over budget. Edit the `.md` and
     decrement Unspent Points **allowing it to go negative** — write the negative
     value into the Points Summary / Identity "Unspent Points" field so the
     deficit shows honestly on the sheet. Collect into the applied batch. Log a
     prominent **`⚠ OVERRIDE`** terminal line (character · what changed · resulting
     unspent) so you always see what was pushed through on the player's word.
   - **Unaffordable with no override — refuse politely.** Apply nothing; finalize
     with the point-math explanation so the player knows exactly how short they
     are and can re-send with an override:

     ```bash
     npx gm-apprentice-publish inbox reply <id> rejected "Ronin → Sex Appeal +2 (11→13). Costs 6; he has 5. One short — nothing applied. Send it again with \"GM said OK\" to override."
     ```

     Then log a `⚠` line (character · what was asked · "can't afford — nothing applied").
   - **Ambiguous — ask, don't guess.** If you genuinely can't tell *what* the
     player means (which skill, which item), do not edit. Finalize with a
     **`rejected`** reply asking which they meant:

     ```bash
     npx gm-apprentice-publish inbox reply <id> rejected "Which skill did you mean — Guns (Pistol) or Gunner? Send it again naming one."
     ```

     Then log a `⚠` line (character · the ambiguous request · "needs clarification").
     An override bypasses affordability, never an unknown target.
3. **Question → answer** using **player-safe scope only** — the published
   sheet/site + GURPS rules + the character's own non-GM sections. NEVER use
   `GM Notes`, `DM Notes`, `Player Notes`, `Source References`,
   `<!-- gm-only -->` regions, other PCs' private data, or hidden plot/secret.
   If a good answer would need GM-only info, reply that it's beyond what you
   can see — never the hidden info itself. Answer as a brief bullet list, then
   finalize:

   ```bash
   npx gm-apprentice-publish inbox reply <id> advice $'• DX 13→14 = 20 pts …\n• you have 15 — not yet affordable'
   ```
   Multi-line replies (like bullet lists) require real newlines in the chat log — use bash `$'...'` quoting so `\n` becomes a newline.
4. **Publish the applied batch once.** If the applied batch is non-empty,
   `npm run build` then `npx wrangler@4 pages deploy`.
   - **On deploy success:** finalize each applied id with its confirmation:

     ```bash
     npx gm-apprentice-publish inbox reply <id> applied "✓ Streetwise 2→3 — applied"
     ```

     An override's confirmation names the override and the resulting deficit:

     ```bash
     npx gm-apprentice-publish inbox reply <id> applied "✓ Six → DX 13→14 — GM override applied; Unspent now −5 (reconcile when you can)."
     ```
   - **On deploy failure:** do **not** reply — the entries stay `pending`
     (nothing else marks them) and are pulled again on the next watcher cycle.
     Log the failure.
5. **Relaunch the background watcher** (the same command as in Start step 4) so
   the next request wakes you. Idle resumes at zero model-token cost.

Once a request reaches a terminal outcome it returns exactly one response to
the chat log: `applied` (sheet redeployed), `rejected` (with the point-math
reason), or `advice`. A deploy failure leaves the applied items `pending` to
retry next tick, unreplied for now. `reply` is the single finalizer for every
item — it supersedes the old `handled`/`flag` commands.

## Terminal log format

One line per request so a glance tells the whole story:

```text
✓ 14:32  Ana — Streetwise +1 (1 pt)      applied · live
✓ 14:32  Bo  — added TL11 stun baton      applied · live
⚠ 14:33  Cy  — spend 20 pts on DX         needs 40, has 15 · NEEDS YOU
```

## Stop

On "stop", **flush live state to the vault, then terminate the background
watcher** and do not relaunch it:

1. Run `npx gm-apprentice-publish flush` (or `node <tool>/bin/gm-publish.js
   flush`). This snapshots each PC's current live vitals back into their vault
   `.md` (for GURPS: current HP and FP into the `## Current Status` block; the
   writeback is system-aware), so the site's fallback seed stays fresh past
   KV's 30-day TTL. It edits the vault source only (no rebuild/deploy); the
   values ride into the site on the next `npm run build`. Report its per-PC
   summary. Skill experience ticks are left untouched — those belong to
   Advancement, not the flush. A PC whose current status is authored as a
   YAML `status:` *object* in frontmatter (rather than the `## Current Status`
   body block) is skipped with a warning: the build reads vitals from that
   frontmatter and ignores the body, so a body write wouldn't take effect —
   author current status in the body block to let flush sync it.
2. Terminate the background watcher.

The session code stays set in KV until the next "start your checking loop"
replaces it. `flush` is also safe to run ad hoc at any time — it is idempotent,
so re-running it when nothing changed is a harmless no-op.

## Editing the PC `.md`

Edit the vault file in place — it is the source of truth; the deploy reflects
it. Locate unspent/earned points and the relevant section by reading the file
(GURPS sheets carry an Identity block with Point Total / Unspent Points / Total
Points Earned, plus Attributes, Skills, and an equipment list). A crash between
editing a `.md` and the deploy leaves the entry `pending`, so the next watcher
cycle pulls it again. Before applying any request, first check whether its
change is already present in the `.md` (the attribute is already at the target
level and the unspent points already reflect the cost); if so, treat the apply
as a no-op and let it ride to the next deploy. This makes re-processing safe.
